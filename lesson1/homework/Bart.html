<h1>Bart Simpson</h1>
<img src="img/Bart.png" alt="Bart">
<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1 or February 23) is the Deuteragonist of The Simpsons.
    <br><br>

    Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child. He is the
    only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo",
    after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical
    Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the
    Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
    <br><br>
    Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series, he has
    discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
    Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.</p>
